# 🛰️ IoT Integration – COSMOpet Prototype

## 1. Current Alpha Stage

COSMOpet is in alpha stage and does not yet use real IoT hardware. However, the system is designed to simulate satellite and biometric inputs to prepare for real-time integration.

- 🌍 Urban environmental stress is modeled using Copernicus data layers (Sentinel-4, HR-VPP)
- 📍 Positioning is simulated via Galileo GNSS logic (city-level urban context)
- 🔬 Response logic is triggered using WHO reference thresholds

## 2. Future Roadmap (2025–2026)

a) With support from partners such as **Kineis** and **AllThingsTalk**, COSMOpet plans to incorporate real IoT devices by end 2025:

| IoT Component | Function | Phase |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| 🔊 Noise sensor | Detect ambient stressors | Q4 2025 |
| ❤️ Heart rate monitor | Biometric stress detection | Q1 2026 |
| 📲 Mobile sync | AI personalization engine | Q1 2026 |

b) 🛰️ IoT cloud integration will be tested using platforms such as **AllThingsTalk** (official Cassini Hackathon partner for real-time sensor dashboards and connectivity).

## 3. Data Protection & Ethics

- 🔐 **Privacy-first**: user input is anonymized
- 📜 **GDPR-compliant**: EU Regulation 2016/679  
- 🤝 **Transparency**: open-source logic and public roadmap

COSMOpet collects no sensitive personal data. Sensor-based features will include informed consent options.

## 4. Pilot Network & Local Partners

Already collaborating in Italy with:

- 🏛️ Municipality of Serdiana  
- 🧠 Pediatric and veterinary advisors  
- 🎵 Music therapy and Blue Zone longevity researchers  
- 🤝 NGOs: ARKA Eventi Culturali & Sardonia Italia

These partners have provided letters of intent and pilot participation support.

---

## 5. EU-Ready Replicability

Thanks to modular logic, the IoT system is compatible with:

- National health and education systems
- Local languages and cultural approaches
- NGO and school-driven implementation

📌 Future co-design opportunities are open to EU Hackathon participants.

## 6. Field Exploration (May 2025)

During the final sprint of the CASSINI Hackathon, we retrieved simulated satellite tracking data using the ARGOS satellite passes over Bologna (May 16–18, 2025).  

We explored the data structure provided by AllThingsTalk and Kineis as part of the official [CASSINI IoT Kit](https://github.com/allthingstalk/cassini-hackathons/blob/main/README.md), including:

- 📡 PreviPass ARGOS logs (CSV + Excel)
- 🛰️ Satellite visibility times for Bologna
- 🧪 Simulated noise and heart rate parameters (future scope)

This confirms COSMOpet's commitment to full integration of real-time IoT telemetry.

> A visual trace of this analysis is available via our [Methodology](https://github.com/TizyM/COSMOpet/blob/main/methodology.md) section and Hackathon pitch deck.
