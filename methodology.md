# ðŸ§ª COSMOpet â€“ Methodology

This document outlines the development strategy, data sources, and rationale behind the COSMOpet prototype.

## 1. Objective

COSMOpet was designed as a modular, scalable tool to support children's mental well-being through interaction with a virtual pet. It uses space-enhanced data to assess environmental stress and deliver adaptive interventions such as music, relaxation prompts, and breathing games.

## 2. Data Collection

COSMOpet integrates open-source Earth Observation data from the Copernicus Programme:

- **Air Quality Data**  
  Source: [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/data)  
  Parameters used: NOâ‚‚, PM10, Oâ‚ƒ â€“ via Sentinel-4

- **Urban Vegetation Mapping**  
  Source: [Copernicus HR-VPP](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/high-resolution-vegetation-phenology-and-productivity)  
  Used for mapping green access (Sentinel-2)

- **Geolocation**  
  Based on Galileo GNSS (simulated)

## 3. Data Processing Logic

1. Retrieve environmental data for the userâ€™s location  
2. Compare values to WHO health stress thresholds  
3. If exceeded â†’ trigger digital therapy content  
4. (Optional) Sensor data (noise, heart rate) refine intervention

## 4. Use Case Testing

Simulated environment snapshots tested for:
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Milan
- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡· Athens

Outcomes:  
- High pollution and low green space â†’ AI recommends breathing games, hydration, sound therapy.

## 5. Replicability

The methodology is replicable across EU thanks to open data and modular logic. COSMOpet adapts easily to:

- Local languages
- Health system variations
- NGO, school or municipal partnerships

## 6. Ethical Compliance

All logic is designed respecting child mental well-being. No personal data are stored. Future deployments will include opt-in forms, GDPR-compliant flows, and transparency dashboards.
