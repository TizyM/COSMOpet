## 🛰️ Note on Sentinel-4 (Air Quality Data)

The COSMOpet prototype currently simulates Sentinel-4 satellite data to detect environmental stressors such as **NO₂, PM10, and O₃** levels.  
Although Sentinel-4 is not yet fully operational (expected mid-2025), our logic is designed to be compatible with its upcoming capabilities.

In the meantime, we emulate air quality readings using methodology aligned with **CAMS – Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service**, enabling realistic test conditions for COSMOpet’s urban wellness mission.

## 💬 Chatbot – COSMOpet Demo Preview

We have also created a **prototype preview page** of the COSMOpet chatbot assistant:  
a simulated conversational interface where the mascot COSMO will help children and families explore health content.

🎯 Demo features include:
- Guided support for nutrition, psychology, music therapy and events
- Trigger-based suggestions (air quality, stress)
- GDPR-compliant contact form

👉 [Click here to open the chatbot simulation](https://tizym.github.io/COSMOpet/chatbot-cosmopet.html)

> 🧪 This is a **static preview** for demo purposes only.  
> The chatbot is under development for interactive integration in 2025.

> 🌐 Language switch available directly on the page (🇮🇹/🇬🇧)
