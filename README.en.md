# 🛰️ COSMOpet – Space-Enhanced Pet Therapy for Children's Mental Health

An educational and therapeutic prototype designed to support children's mental well-being using satellite data, artificial intelligence, and an interactive virtual mascot.

🚀 Developed by: Tiziana Mori & Movere 2.0 Team  
Presented at the 9th Cassini Hackathon – Challenge #3: Space for Mental Health

## 🎯 Objective

COSMOpet helps children manage environmental stress (pollution, noise, heat) through playful and calming activities guided by a digital mascot.  
It uses satellite data and AI to activate breathing games and therapeutic music interventions.

## 🛰️ Technology

- **Copernicus Sentinel-4**: NO₂, PM10, heat islands  
- **HR-VPP**: green space detection  
- **Galileo GNSS**: location-based personalization  
- **AI engine**: triggers activities based on stress thresholds

---

## 🧠 Logic and Workflow

1. **Input**: satellite/environmental data  
2. **Trigger**: stress condition detected  
3. **Output**: mascot Cosmo suggests relaxing content (music, games, breathing)

## 🌍 Scalability and Replication

While developing the project, we conducted a comparative analysis of urban and environmental data among European countries participating in the Cassini Hackathon, aligning with their shared goals in prevention and mental health.

Countries considered: Germany, France, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Romania, Greece and Italy.

COSMOpet is designed to be easily adapted to other European local contexts, and we are open to collaboration with interested countries.

## 🔗 Future IoT Integration

We are exploring:
- **AllThingsTalk** for environmental sensor dashboard  
- **Kineis** for satellite-based connectivity

👉 Future plans: [`iot-integration.md`](./iot-integration.md)
